This file is dedicated to showing you, what I'm working on, and what I want to achieve with this project.

/\/\/\---This file should also be seen as the priority list for anyone wanting to contribute to the project!---\\\\\

It is also important to notice that for the time being, the engine is just going to be a few header files, 
that anyone can import into their project. But, as mentioned in long term goals, an editor will be a thing in the future,
if I can continue to work on the project.

Goals being worked on right now:

 - ~~Audio playback~~ (Done ^_^)
 - Audio file streaming support
 
Short Term Goals:

 - Support for 2D textures of filetype : 
    - .bmp
    - .png
    - (just for the sake of supporting it) jpg/jpeg
 - Better handeling of dynamic nested objects
 - Support for previewing Areas
 - Lighting physics
 - An upgrade to the very poorly written collision physics
 - Add the usage of temp directories and files, so that we can stop filling up the RAM every 5 seconds

Long Term Goals
 - An UI editor, that utilizes the headers of the engine
 - (A working engine....)
 - (Teach Anzo use webhooks correctly, and not fuck everything up...)
 
 This list will be updated as development continues :)
